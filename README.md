Etch-A-Sketch
-------------
Built for The Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

At start the plan is to build a container of set dimensions to be filled with
squares (default 16x16, but user definable) using CSS Grid.  Within JavaScript
I will add a random color to squares with a Mouseover event listener.

Succeeded in using CSS Grid and mouseover event listeners to change colors of
squares in a user defined grid.  Able to 'paint' in black, random rainbow, or
in progressively drarker greyscale as well as erase without reloading.

On a screen less than 800px wide, the drawing area resizes to 300x300.
